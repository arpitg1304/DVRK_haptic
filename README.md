# DVRK_haptic

# This project involves the following tasks:
1.) Create a virtual haptic environment for simulating the surgical procedures

2.) Teleoperate the master side manipulator using various haptic devices like Geomagic touch, falcon, and ultimately Da Vinci Master side manipulator

3.) Receive the force feedback from CHAI 3D environme and using computer torque control to back propagate this force to Joint torques of the haptic device

# Softwares used: CHAI 3D, ROS, OPENGL, GLFW library, C++, Python, Bullet physics engine


# Video of the final project outcome:
